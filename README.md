# Development Environment

This program was built using Erlang, and needs to be run within the Erlang shell. 
If you have the Erlang shell, you can use the terminal to cd into the appropriate file where this program is located (meaning the .beam file, not the .erl file) and use the command program_server:cli() to start the command line interface.
